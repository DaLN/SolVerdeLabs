## Vision

The world we live in is getting more and more chaotic with an increasing number of apparent failure points due to complexity generated by global boundlessness.

The 21st century will be **local** & **interconnected** (see Fractal Localism). Communities need to be resilient, sustainable but also able to exchange and collaborate with others. For that we need to create better models, develop and implement technologies and find new ways to be together.

## Mission 

How can we maximize the human potential ? Liberate the intrinsic creativity of individuals towards making the community better as a whole ?

This project aims to investigate, experiment and apply the different ways to reach those goals.

For that I foresee:
* co-living offer for creators
* off-grid community village with hack/maker lab
* an incubator & fund "with profit" model 
* a regenerative economy enabled by a currency

### Off-grid community village

Inspirations : 
* *Precipice* from [The Shockwave Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shockwave_Rider)
*  [The Unplugged](https://www.shareable.net/the-unplugged/)

A *village*, using regenerative and resilient technology, with pods ([Niu Haus](https://niu-haus.com)) and common buildings for the community to have shared spaces. A Hack/Maker space where we research and build tools for the *village* itself but also the broader community. 

The *village* provide high quality sustenance obtained the more locally possible, ideally produced on site using technologies developped or implemented by members. A curated offer of physical and spiritual practices will be proposed to promote a high quality of living, this include yoga, martial arts, body therapies, creative practices, meditation, among other things. Regular workshops and talks to share knowledge among members will be organised by members but also specialists from the broader community.

This *village* can organise retreats, hackathons, conferences around themes connected to the general vision.

#### How do we start ?

Having strong ties with [Amara Valley](https://amaravalley.com/)'s residents i perceive the possibility to experiment with new models there. 

Hosting this project in that context would be ideally aligned with its goals.

The project in itself will be started using [Protocol.Love](https://cogov.tech/protocol.love/) created by Raymond D. Powell.

> Protocol.Love fosters the emergence of a socioeconomic system infused with Loving Kindness for organizations who choose a commitment to Vulnerable Transparency.

The first phase will be curating a co-living offer for a carefully selected cohort of first members, with ensuite appartements, private rooms or geodesic domes for the members that prefer to be closer to nature. Among the accessible facilities there is an office, pool, yoga shala, podcast studio and sauna.

They will be able to enjoy nutritious lunch and dinners, daily morning yoga and meditation practices as well as access to top notch body workers and art teachers in the domains of painting and music.

Access to the regular retreats organised by Amara Valley will be offered to members.

##### Amara's mission statement :

> The mission of Amara Valley is to create a healing sanctuary of profound beauty, that enhances the wellness and development of everyone who comes here.
> 
> A nurturing place where we can learn to live in harmony, where our creativity can become reality, and where we are all able to reimagine and develop every aspect of our individual, and collective, potential.
> 
> Through transformative retreats, courses and gatherings, we seek to provide a home where Regenerative culture in all its forms can be cultivated and celebrated.
> 
> We strive to grow together, remembering those who came before us and honouring those who are yet to come, providing strength and insight to each other wherever we can, and committing deeply to serving the web of Life on the Earth.
> 
> We are guided by openness, kindness, happiness and love.

### Community incubator "with profit" model 

* Create a token bonding curve fund (Commons Stack style) with key Regenerative actors involved as a Trusted Seed. 
* Use the fund to loan / bootstrap regenerative ventures. 
* Find a model where the extended community become (part) co-owner of the ventures created by each individual but the individuals retain main ownership, authority and autonomy to fully develop their ideas. 

This would foster an environment where people would be able to use their creativity, gifts and skills to create innovative projects and help each other in that process. The social and monetary value created by the successful ventures would be *partly* co-owned by each member of the community which would allow it to grow its positive impact in the world.

### Hacker/Maker space

Examples of domains of research:
* a digital currency fostering a circular and regenerative economy. Local in the domain it applies to but international in its reach.
* financial products for the new economy (token bonding curves, etc).
* new business models that are based on collaboration, trust and a win-win worldview.
* technology assisted farming, think Farmbot or ROMI.
* communication and information sharing tools.
* water filtration systems
* compost systems
* sustainable energy
* decision making systems
* mapping and analysis tools to evaluate personal and social resilience
* on/off-line education platform

## Values
* Openness
    * willingness to integrate different point of views into the existing framework
        * diversity of thought in the teams and projects
        * processes that welcome discussion and disagreement
* Experimentation

        * organisation of workshops
        * public documentation of internal processes
        * public documentation of projects, past or current
* Technology
    * techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, which can be embedded in machines to allow for operation.
        * research around techniques or machines to enable the sustainability of the community
        * technology assisted farming
        * permaculture
* Excellence
    * The quality of always going above board to reach the best result possible.
        * use of the best tools available
* Avant-guard
    * A group that creates or promotes innovative ideas or techniques in a given field, especially in the arts.
        * projects and methods used are at the cutting edge of their domains
* Clarity / Transparency
    * Data is public and explained
        * open source projects
        * communication of decisions and processes involved.


Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps (SCIM)
---
Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps http://resiliencemaps.org/

Individual level:
* Shelter
* Supply (food, water)
* Safety

Group level:
* Communications
* Space
* Transportation
* Resource control

Organization level:
* Shared Map
* Shared Plan
* Shared Succession Model

A community maps to those three levels above which are part of SCIM. It should provide Shelter, Supply and Safety to their members.

The community needs a Space for this, Transportation to go from and to the Space, a way to manage shared resources in the Space and Communications system to exchange with the outside world and more specifically the Organizations it is part of.

Provided that, the community will find like minded communities with whom they share a similar vision or Map to what the situation is, agree on a Plan to move forward and have systems to make the organization work (exchanges, disputes, succession, etc).
